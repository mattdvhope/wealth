## **The creator of Money**

Who creates money? Most folks incorrectly answer, "the government." But from a [cursory study](http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/where-does-money-come-from-the-giant-federal-reserve-scam-that-most-americans-do-not-understand), a person can find money's origin:

In America, the Federal Reserve, a private banking cartel owned by the wealthiest bankers in the world lends gargantuan sums of money -- money created out of nothing -- primarily to the U.S. government, and then has the gall to collect interest on that debt:  Twenty Trillion and counting today.

The Fed has conducted this piracy on the grandest scale since its founding in 1913.

Yet do we know of money's _**ultimate**_ origin?  I recall back to Jesus' day when his accusers sought to draw Him into a dilemma by asking,

_"Is it right to pay the imperial tax to Caesar or not?"_

Jesus responded by requesting from them a Roman coin and then asking, _"Whose image is this? And whose inscription?"_

_"Caesar’s,"_ they replied.

Then He said, _"So give back to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God what is God’s."_

Or, more famously in the old King James, _"Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's."_

## **Caesar's coins**

Jesus, the Creator God of all the universe understood money's ultimate origin. He knew who had minted the coin in His accuser's hand. So He gave those around him a lesson on money:

This coin did not find its source in God, but rather in Caesar. Thus Jesus told those around him to simply give the money back to its source -- Caesar.

God makes people in His image while Caesar makes coins in his. Thus we must give _ourselves_ to God while giving our coins to Caesar. We give it back to its source.

Emperor Tiberius ruled when Jesus made that statement, so had Tiberius himself minted that coin? Obviously a Roman mint somewhere had stamped it with Tiberius' impression on it.

So who set up that mint? Who gave it the authority, power and the silver necessary to bring that coin into existence?

From my arduous plod through David Astle's ponderous classic, "[The Babylonian Woe](http://www.colchestercollection.com/titles/chunk/B/babylonian-woe/chapter1.html)," I have gleaned answers to these questions:

There has existed in our world since the  ancient Mesopotamians in 3000 B.C. secret cabals of evil, unimaginably powerful bankers who secretly lend out fiat currency created from nothing.

From them we find the source of all money.  Yet, can we not find an even deeper source?

## **The offer**

Early in Jesus' ministry, "the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory. And he said to him, 'All these I will give you, if you will fall down and worship me.'"

Did Satan have the ability to fulfill his tempting offer to Jesus. Yes, absolutely. Jesus never contradicted Satan on his ability to make good on the offer, rather He simply rejected it by saying, "Get thee behind me, Satan!"

Could we not extrapolate that if Satan had the ability to make this offer to Jesus, he could also make it to an ordinary person?

The billionaires of the world almost universally follow immoral and collectivist ideals, including especially the push for a one-world government -- a New World Order presumedly one day under the Antichrist.

Could not Satan have approached at least some of the billionaires -- particularly the mega-powerful bankers -- and offered them something similar to what he had offered Jesus?

## **The unsolvable problem**

Many on the web rightly lambast the injustice of the, "Evil Federal Reserve."  They dream of slaying this [Hydra](https://www.loc.gov/pictures/resource/cph.3a05364/).

Yet I do not think humanity will ever ultimately defeat it.  I do not believe God will allow mere human beings to overpower this "[Creature from Jekyll Island](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?LH_CAds=&_ex_kw=&_fpos=&_fspt=1&_mPrRngCbx=1&_nkw=creature+from+jekyll+island+book&_sacat=&_sadis=&_sop=12&_udhi=&_udlo=&_fosrp=1)."  Or if they do, the slain "Fed Creature" would soon resurrect into something similar.

God has given Satan, the "prince of the power of the air," temporary authority over this world.

That power will not subside until Jesus Himself returns in great power, defeating the dragon Satan with the sword in His mouth and binding him for a 1000 years in Hades.

Money, that "main spring of history," gives Satan temporary power over the world. No human power, no matter how compelling, will wrest that control mechanism from him.

Thus I feel very pessimistic in the near term, but wildly optimistic in the eternal term. Jesus will return and take back the earth for Himself!

He will defeat this sorcerer / sourc-er \[of money] and His people will one day hear it said, "Let the one who is thirsty come; let the one who desires take the water of life _**without price**_."
