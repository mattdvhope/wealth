## **The creator of Money**

Who creates money? Most folks incorrectly answer, "the government." But from a [cursory study](http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/where-does-money-come-from-the-giant-federal-reserve-scam-that-most-americans-do-not-understand), a person can find money's origin:

In America, the Federal Reserve, a private banking cartel owned by the wealthiest bankers in the world lends gargantuan sums of money -- money they have created out of nothing -- primarily to the U.S. government, and then have the gall to collect interest on that money! Twenty Trillion and counting today!

Piracy on the grandest of all scales since the Fed's founding in 1913!

Yet do these commentators truly know of money's **_ultimate_** origin? I hope to find out, or at least to theorize intelligently based upon the available evidence.

I recall back to Jesus' day when his accusers sought to draw Him into a dilemma by asking,

_"Is it right to pay the imperial tax to Caesar or not?"_

Jesus responded by asking them for a Roman coin and then said, _"Whose image is this? And whose inscription?"_

_"Caesar’s,"_ they replied.

Then He said, _"So give back to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God what is God’s."_

Or, more famously in the old King James, _"Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's."_

## _<u>_**Caesar's</u> coins**

Jesus, the Creator God of all the universe understood money's ultimate origin. He knew who had minted that coin in His accuser's hand. So He gave those around him a lesson on money:

This coin did not find its source in God, but rather in Caesar. Thus Jesus told those around him to simply give the money back to its source -- Caesar.

God does not source money! Caesar does! God makes people in His image while Caesar makes coins in his. Thus we must give _ourselves_ to God while unflappably giving our money to Caesar. Give it back to its source!

Emperor Tiberius ruled when Jesus made that statement, so had Tiberius himself minted that coin? I doubt it. Obviously a Roman mint somewhere had stamped it with Tiberius' impression on it.

So who set up that mint? Who gave it the authority, power and the silver necessary to bring that coin into existence? I want to pursue the answer in coming days.

I plan to continue my arduous plod through David Astle's ponderous classic, "[The Babylonian Woe](http://www.colchestercollection.com/titles/chunk/B/babylonian-woe/chapter1.html)."

From what I have gleaned so far, this "great problem" of secret cabals of evil, unimaginably powerful bankers secretly lending out fiat currency they have created from nothing has existed continuously and unbrokenly since the ancient Mesopotamians in 3000 B.C.

## **The offer**

Early in Jesus' ministry, "the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory. And he said to him, 'All these I will give you, if you will fall down and worship me.'"

Did Satan have the ability to make good on that tempting offer to Jesus. I would contend, "yes, absolutely." Jesus never contradicted Satan on the fact of his ability to make good on such an offer, rather He simply rejected the offer: "Be gone, Satan!"

Could I not extrapolate that if Satan had the ability to make this offer to Jesus, could He not also make it to an ordinary person?

Why do the billionaires of the world almost universally follow immoral, leftist values including especially the push for a one-world government -- a New World Order?

Could not Satan have approached at least some of them -- particularly the mega-powerful bankers -- and presented them a similar offer to that given to Jesus?

## **The unsolvable problem**

Unlike many on the web lambasting the injustice of the rightly characterized, "Evil Federal Reserve," and dreaming of ways to slay this [Hydra](https://www.loc.gov/pictures/resource/cph.3a05364/), I don't think we will ever defeat it.

In fact, I don't think God will allow us to defeat this "[Creature from Jekyll Island](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?LH_CAds=&_ex_kw=&_fpos=&_fspt=1&_mPrRngCbx=1&_nkw=creature+from+jekyll+island+book&_sacat=&_sadis=&_sop=12&_udhi=&_udlo=&_fosrp=1)."

God has given Satan, the "prince of the power of the air," temporary authority over this world.

That power will not subside until Jesus Himself returns in great power, defeating the dragon Satan with the sword in His mouth and binding him for a 1000 years in Hades.

Money, that "main spring of history," gives Satan this temporary power over the world. No human power, no matter how compelling or forceful in its argument, will wrest that control mechanism from him.

Thus I feel very pessimistic in the near term, but wildly optimistic in the eternal term. Jesus will return and take back this earth for Himself!

He will defeat this sorcerer / sourc-er \[of money] and His people will one day hear it said, "Let the one who is thirsty come; let the one who desires take the water of life **_without price_**."
